       [11]Ask HN: Why is on-device search terrible?

       My search experience across a lot of products is, to put it
       bluntly, garbage. Apple Mail, Gmail App on Android, Finder
       search, Windows Explorer search, MacOs Spotlight... rarely find
       what I'm looking for.

       Why is it so bad? Are indexes / Io ops really that expensive?

   On the other hand, search in Photos on iPhone is _scary_ good.

   Searching for “baseball” will return pictures of a baseball, a
   team playing baseball, photos that were taken at the location
   of a baseball stadium, AND photos that literally have the word
   baseball in text somewhere within the photo.

   iOS spotlight used to work well- now there's a three second
   delay at times while it fetches the internet-enabled features.
   All I want is it to find my apps for me!

   I wish there was a way to disable internet search. I used
   spotlight to open apps for years and now it’s not very
   efficient, so I have to organize icons and stuff.

   TL;DR the "fix" is to reset all network settings, or
   alternately, make sure content search is enabled for all your
   apps in Settings.

   Even if the db is not up to date, it's likely faster to
   update/search than rely on find

   I find simple searches by file name useful, but that's also
   because I'm fairly diligent to keep my filesystems organized

   The launcher called Albert is helpful as a sort of Spotlight
   stand-in with Linux (maybe elsewhere?). It does math, runs
   things, and can have things like a dictionary added. I believe
   it can also search

   I am not sure what special permissions you are talking about
   that Albert gets? Just like any other software, it can do
   whatever the user can do. As far as I understand it doesn't
   "phone home" or anything with my data. And doesn't really
   delete or move files in any way.

   On Windows, the fastest way seems to use WizTree to scan the
   whole hard drive (Takes only a couple seconds to scan an SSD,
   and even my 2 TB spinning HD with >900,000 files takes less
   than 15 seconds) and then search the results for the filename.

   Everything search is incredible, for me it serves nearly
   instant searches for 15TB+ of data without any trouble. I think
   the secret sauce is a background service which continuously
   updates the file index.

   This is finally the Windows experience that developers wanted.
   I thought that OneGet (PackageManagement) was going to be the
   way almost a decade ago, but that fizzled out. The guy that
   wrote that one seems to be totally on board with this though:
   [223]https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/discussions/186.

    [222] javascript:void(0)
    [223] https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/discussions/186

   I think that the guy that wrote OneGet had it mostly right, but
   it seems (as a layman who knows nothing about Microsoft) that
   he simply did not have the political power to make it actually
   get picked up by the higher ups at Microsoft and that someone
   else did which is why it took an extra half-decade to actually
   happen.

   I do wonder what would have happened in my career had OneGet
   actually taken off . Previously I used to work exclusively on
   Windows, and I now work exclusively on non-Windows machines. At
   the time that I switched developer experience was one of my
   primary frustrations - and lack of a proper Homebrew/apt/yum
   like experience on Windows was a non-insignificant part of
   that. Chocolatey was OK at the time, but paled in comparison to
   its MacOS and Linux equivalents.

   - For fast search need to use indexes, which tend to be few
   times larger than data. Far on MacOs show 4-5 versions of same
   file ("timemachine" version system).

   I think this is just psychology question, people don't like
   when appear those strange files.

   But the index update wouldn't be in the critical path (when a

   No, an index wouldn't be updated the moment you want to use it.
   I notice when locate and man perform their updates because my
   computer is busy while they do. Granted I think it is low
   priority but I still see the result in btop (or any other
   system monitor program). find isn't quick unless I repeat the
   same search and the directories are cached.

   I am not complaining about spending time on i/o and processing
   to make an index. I merely stated that it does take time. I
   didn't think Windows' one was worth it when I last used Windows
   so I would always disable it but I haven't done likewise on
   linux.
